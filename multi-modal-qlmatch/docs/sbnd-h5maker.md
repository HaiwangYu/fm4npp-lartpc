# SBND HDF5 sample for qlfm: progress log (#11)

Goal: an SBND sample in the MicroBooNE open-data HDF5 layout (zenodo 8370883, `HDF5Maker`). It is built from:
- Avinay's Gen2 reco1 MC (BNB CV; later also νe CC and NC);
- our Wire-Cell img→PR chain output, aurora-r2 (sbnd-wirecell-production #4).

The content follows `data-inventory-sbnd.md` §4. Code: `sbnd-h5maker/` (README = table layout and methods).

Produced on ALCF Aurora:
- data: `/lus/flare/projects/neutrinoGPU/yuhw/fm4npp-lartpc-data`;
- copied for Polaris to `/lus/eagle/projects/neutrinoGPU/yuhw/fm4npp-lartpc-data`.

The Polaris session `fm4npp-lartpc@polaris` checks each sample before the next step.

## Owner decisions (2026-11-12)

- **Wire-Cell content:** event level (ν candidate, flash, scores, reco vertex and energy) plus hit level (WC ν-candidate cluster footprint per gaushit). This is the SBND stand-in for the Pandora baseline.
- **MC truth:** the MicroBooNE edep layout (hit → particle energy and fraction, particle table with category), plus cosmic truth.
- **Per-hit truth:** the reco1 MC has none, so it is built by projecting the 3D Geant4 deposits (below).
- **Sample sizes:** ~10 BNB CV events first, then 10k BNB CV, then a cost estimate for ~1M (CV + νe CC + NC). Nothing larger runs before the owner approves.

## Inputs

- **Reco1:** `/lus/flare/projects/neutrinoGPU/abhat/sbnd/gen2-wct0319-bnb-1m-restartable-20261013-shard0{1..3}` (+ batch01–09).
  - sbndcode v10_14_02_03; `prodgenie_corsika_proton_rockbox0p1_sbnd`, so cosmics are simulated (CORSIKA).
  - 1–3 events per reco1 file.
- **Wire-Cell:** aurora-r2 unit directories `production-prep/dlspace/bnb/node<k>/<unit>/`, with `reco1_files.json` and `pr/all/pr_evt<r>_<s>_<e>/tracking-pr.root`.
  - 11,888 BNB units, 627,114 events with WC output.

## What the reco1 files hold

| Product | Status | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `gaushit` | yes | `hit_table` |
| `gaushitTruthMatch` (hit → MCParticle, BackTrackerHitMatchingData) | **empty** in every event | — |
| `simtpc2d:simpleSC` SimChannels | one per channel (11,276), **no IDEs** | — |
| `ionandscint:priorSCE` SimEnergyDeposits | yes (~12 MB/event) | per-hit truth by projection |
| `largeant` MCParticles + MCParticle→MCTruth assns + ParticleAncestryMap | yes (every particle has an MCTruth) | `particle_table`, origin ν / cosmic |
| `generator` MCTruth, BeamGateInfo | yes | `event_table` |
| `mcreco` MCShower / MCTrack | yes | HDF5Maker particle categories |
| `ophitpmt`, `opflashtpc0/1` | yes; PMT readout ±1.5 ms, ~36k ophits/event | `ophit_table` (−10…40 µs window), `opflash*` (all) |

## Per-hit truth by deposit projection

Each deposit midpoint is processed as follows:
1. Shift it by the forward SCE map (`SCEoffsets_SBND_E500_dualmap_CV_voxelTH3.root`, `TrueFwd_*`), as the Wire-Cell truth labeler does.
2. Drift it to each wire plane at 0.1563 cm/µs.
3. Map it to a channel with the linear wire-plane model from the WCT wire geometry (`sbnd-wires-geometry-v0206`). Every plane is linear to < 0.02 cm, and the channel model agrees with the `(tpc, plane)` of all hits.
4. Compute tick = 410 + 2·(t_G4 + t_drift)[µs] + dt[plane].
5. Sum the deposits per particle within the hit's PeakTime ± 1 RMS, the larsim BackTracker window.

Calibration on the first 3 BNB CV events, maximising the hits that get a deposit:
- dt = +5 (U), +2 (V), −2 (Y) ticks;
- the peaks are broad (±2 ticks within 0.2%).

| 10 BNB CV events | dt = 0 | dt = (5, 2, −2), ±1 RMS | dt = (5, 2, −2), ±2 RMS |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hits with no deposit | 45,587 (30.6%) | 3,788 (2.5%) | 3,109 (2.1%) |
| ν energy on collection hits / projected ν energy (collection) | 89.9% | 91.5% | 101.5% (double counting) |
| WC ν-cluster hit purity vs truth ν hits | 0.78 | 0.87 | 0.89 |

The default is ±1 RMS.

## 10k BNB CV (2026-11-12)

`sbnd-bnb-cv/10k/sbnd_bnb_cv_10k_000..020.h5`:
- 205 aurora-r2 units, evenly spaced over the 11,872 OK units of the 1M production (`units.txt`); 10,754 events.
- Run with `pbs/run-many.pbs`: 21 parts of 10 units, 24 processes on one capacity node.
- Every part rc 0, 11–21 min, 1.5–2.1 GB RSS.
- 2.14 process-seconds per event, including the ~50 s compile per process.

| Quantity | 10k BNB CV |
|---|---|
| Events / with WC output | 10,754 / 10,754 |
| Neutrinos (`nu_table`) / event-level ν vertex in AV / CC | 19,402 / 4,807 / 8,032 |
| Hits / per event | 132.4M / 12.3k |
| Hits with ν deposit > 0.05 MeV / cosmic / none | 6.41M / 122.7M / 3.16M (2.4%) |
| Projected ν energy on collection planes landing on hits | 92.2% |
| PMT ophits in −10…40 µs / per event | 19.4M / 1.8k |
| WC ν candidates (events) | 5,155 (5,055) |
| WC ν-cluster hit purity vs truth (all / main cluster) | 0.89 / 0.93 |
| Size | 3.89 GB = 362 kB/event |

## Estimate for the full sample (not run; needs the owner's approval)

The full sample is the aurora-r2 production: 627,205 BNB CV + 268,865 νe CC + 26,745 NC Δ-radiative = 922,815 events.

| | Basis | Full sample |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | 2.14 process-s/event | ~550 process-hours |
| Node-hours, measured packing (24 processes/node) | 0.35 node-h per 10.75k events | ~30 node-h |
| Node-hours, 64 processes/node (RSS 2 GB, 102 cores; not yet measured) | if Lustre keeps up | ~12 node-h |
| Disk on Flare | 362 kB/event (BNB; νe CC events have more ν hits) | ~0.33 TB (±30%), ~1,850 files of ~500 events |
| Copy on Eagle | same | ~0.33 TB; rsync ran at ~130 MB/s, so ~45 min |

Suggested plan: 8 capacity nodes × 64 processes, about 2–4 h wall, after one 64-process pilot node to confirm the packing.

## Review 1 (fm4npp-lartpc_polaris, 2026-11-12)

The Polaris session approved the 10k run once two changes were in.
- h5reader reads every table unchanged. A scratch SBND variant of convert.py converts all 10 events, and the batch path works.
- The ν labels are usable for T1/T2.
- The PMT map and the −10…40 µs light window are fine.

Requested changes, all done in sbnd-h5maker 0.3:
- **A (required): multiple neutrinos per spill.** Added `nu_table`, `nu_index` in `edep_table` and `particle_table`, and the event-level choice rule (attribute `nu_choice`). Event 0 of test10 now takes the in-AV neutrino (54 collection hits) instead of the out-of-cryostat one at x = 390.
- **B (required): units.** The event times are now `nu_time_ns`, `beam_gate_start_ns` and `beam_gate_width_ns`, and a `units` attribute lists the units of every column.
- **C (nice to have): simulation configuration.** The detsim and hit-finder settings are in `sbnd_detector.json` "simulation" and the `sim_config` attribute.

## Review 2: fine-tune test (fm4npp-lartpc_polaris, 2026-11-12)

qlfm runs on SBND (`QLFM_DETECTOR=sbnd`, fm4npp-lartpc eea8fe1). The 10k was split 80/10/10, with 6 runs of 3,000 steps on one A100.
- The MicroBooNE-pretrained model, fine-tuned, beats scratch on every task: T1 charge-weighted hit F1 0.85 vs 0.60–0.70, T5 light MSE 0.66 vs 0.97. A frozen encoder does much worse on T1 (0.49).
- No run is converged at 3,000 steps, and scratch is the furthest from it.
- The format, per-ν truth, `_ns` units and `sim_config` work as delivered.

Requested:
- **(a) Required: WC hit labels.** They matched on U in TPC 0 and Y in TPC 1 only. Cause: Wire-Cell numbers channels plane-major ([U0 U1][V0 V1][Y0 Y1]), LArSoft TPC-major. A per-(tpc, plane) channel-shift scan of the footprints against the hits gives WC = LArSoft + (0, +1984, +3968) in TPC 0 and (−3654, −1670, 0) in TPC 1.
  - Fixed in 0.4 (`wc_channel_offsets` attribute).
  - `check_h5.py` now reports WC efficiency and purity per (tpc, plane) and flags a plane below 0.2.
  - The existing files were relabelled with `relabel_wc.py`; only `wc_hit_table` changed.
- **(b) Strongly wanted: a νe CC sample**, so that T3 is a real 3-class task (BNB CV has ~30 νe CC per 10k). This waits for the owner's approval.

WC labels after the fix:

| | test10 before | test10 after | 10k after |
|---|---|---|---|
| WC ν-cluster hits: efficiency / purity vs truth ν hits (> 0.05 MeV, all events) | 0.29 / 0.87 | 0.85 / 0.91 | 0.66 / 0.90 |
| Main cluster: efficiency / purity | 0.17 / 0.88 | 0.55 / 0.93 | 0.55 / 0.93 |
| Per (tpc, plane), charge-weighted, events with a WC candidate: efficiency | 0.96, 0, 0 / 0.002, 0, 0.90 | 0.90–0.96 | 0.89–0.91 (purity 0.92–0.94) |

The 10k efficiency counts the ν hits of every event, including those where WC has no ν candidate.

Checks after the fix:
- A fresh 0.4 conversion of test10 (job 9081816, rc 0) matches the relabelled 0.3 file in every dataset.
- Polaris re-scored T1 with the fixed labels on the same 425 test events (ν vertex in the AV): WC ν clusters reach charge-weighted F1 0.912 (efficiency 0.892, purity 0.933) and per-event median 0.919. Fine-tuned qlfm reaches 0.852 / 0.836.
- So WC leads by ~0.06 on T1 after 3,000 qlfm steps on 3.6k hit-labelled events. The per-event means are close (0.79 vs 0.77) because WC has no candidate in some events.

## Notes for the qlfm side

Differences from the MicroBooNE files:
- **Two TPCs:** `tpc` is 0 for x < 0 and 1 for x > 0, and the drift sign differs per TPC. Wires: 1,984 U / 1,984 V / 1,670 Y per TPC, 0.3 cm pitch. Readout 3,427 ticks of 0.5 µs; trigger at tick 410.
- **PMTs:** 120 PMTs, OpChannel 0–311, mixed with X-ARAPUCA channel numbers. There is no `hit_channel < 32` assumption to keep. Channel → (x, y, z, type) is in the `detector` attribute.
- **Cosmic truth:** `edep_table` keeps MicroBooNE semantics (ν only); the cosmic deposits are in `edep_cosmic_table`.
- **WC labels** replace the Pandora tables.
